# Donation Campaign:
( React Based Assignment-08 by **Programming HeroTeam** )



*In my assignment-8 Donation Campaign project, I've  encountered the need to manage state effectively, as it plays a pivotal role in creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces using React. I can provide you with insights into how state management typically works in React, and these approaches are quite relevant to my project.*

**According to assignment three Project Features are:** 
-


- **Dynamic Category Cards:** : Display a list of donation categories with images, titles, descriptions, and donation prices. These cards should be dynamically generated based on the requirements of P.HeroTeam and assighnment.

- **Search Functionality:** : Implement a search bar and card that allows users to search for donation categories by name and details.  The search should filter and display matching category cards instantly.

- **Statistics Visualization:** : Create an interactive pie chart in the "Statistics" page that visually represents the user's donation percentage compared to the total donation. Clicking on the chart should show the user's donation percentage and the remaining percentage.



**Effective five Git Commit Messages:**
-

- **Implement Dynamic Category Cards**  : Effortlessly incorporate meticulously organized fake data (donation.json) and dynamic retrieval into the project for enhanced functionality and realism. And added functionality to dynamically generate category cards based on provided data.
